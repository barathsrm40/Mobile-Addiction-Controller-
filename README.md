AI-Based Automated Answer Sheet Evaluation System
Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating student answer sheets automatically using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes students’ answers, compares them with model answers, and assigns marks based on semantic similarity, keyword matching, and relevance. This reduces manual effort and ensures faster and unbiased evaluation.
